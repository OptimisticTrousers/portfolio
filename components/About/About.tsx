        <p>
          Hey! I'm Abdul Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early
          age, and been passionate about it ever since. I really liked to build
          stuff using no-code tools back in 2010, and from that, I explored how
          to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various
          languages and technologies, and had the privilege to worked in a B2B
          Company and a Recruitment Company I'm interested in building something
          awesome with code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on
          Web & Mobile Development, Open Source and Competitive Programming When
          I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on
          Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
