          Hi! I'm Tony Isern. I love building things and the freedom that
          programming gives you. I'm currently studying at New Jersey City
          University with a major in Computer Science as a sophomore.
          <br />
          <br />
          Web development is a space where things are constantly changing. Hell,
          a new JS framework seems to come out every week! I love learning new
          technologies and new skills. I pride myself in my persistance and
          dedication to pursuing my goals. One thing I would like to do in the
          future is to teach others the things I am currently learning! To me,
          programming is the most relaxing and soothing thing I can do. No
          distractions, I can collect my thoughts, and I can do it anywhere with
          an internet connection! I'm planning on applying for internships this
          summer of 2023 to get more experience from more senior developers.
          Currently learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I'm not coding, I'm usually debating with my uncle about
          economics, browsing Reddit, or reading my favorite manga, One Piece!
          On a good day, I might play basketball with some friends! üèÄ
